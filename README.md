*Warning, WIP!*

This code is still a quick hack (a single python script) that just gets me the job done.
I would like to hear your suggestions on improving this miniproject.

# Dependencies
- Selenium
- geckodriver

# Running instructions
1. Run script `sauver.py` in interactive shell
2. After the page loads, log in (only required for tasks from currently running series)
3. Call function `sauver.exec(first task\_no, last task\_no)`
